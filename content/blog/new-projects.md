So I've been contracted for two new projects which is why I haven't posted any new PE solutions lately. What I love about being contracted is that I get to choose my language. For one of the projects, I am using Python because performance is not an issue and it reduces the amount of lines I code over C++/C#. For the other project I am using C# because it involves automating some excel processes and the .NET framework is a perfect tool for that. Python can also use interop tools but the functionality feels more native in C# as opposed to Python and especially C++ (TCHAR and Unicode...).
