supports large integers out of the box. Looks like its time to learn a new language to solve these ProjectEuler problems. As much as I love C++, the memory management required in these problems becomes a heavy burden. Also my BigInt class is very slow since I haven't implemented fast arithmetic methods. So why not use something that is already good code!
