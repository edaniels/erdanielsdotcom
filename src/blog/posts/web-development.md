I landed a job at PATLive here in Tallahassee and I am learning so much about JavaScript and PHP. I never knew how useful jQuery could be and that JavaScript is actually used server side (i.e. Node). This job is also helping me learn a lot about telephony systems like PBX, ACD, and sipX (ezuce too). Haven't posted in months (maybe a year?) but I plan on doing this soon maybe with tips or small projects!
