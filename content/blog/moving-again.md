Why spend money on hosting when you can just use github.io and point your domain at it? See: [Adding or removing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-or-removing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/). 

I really only had my own server at Digital Ocean (oh yeah, I switched from AWS to them for ease of use for a stupid simple site like this) so that I could show off that I had an SSL cert. But really, do you need to trust that its me who wrote these blog posts? If I really cared, I could just use a digest for each post and have my public key live somewhere you can trust.
